Building software for service professionals is different from building for other industries. These are people who spend their days in the field, solving real problems for real customers. They don't have time for complicated interfaces or features they'll never use.

## Understanding the User

The most important lesson: **you have to understand the user's world**.

Service professionals:
- Work on mobile devices, often with dirty hands
- Need information quickly, not buried in menus
- Operate in real-time - jobs change, schedules shift
- Value simplicity over features

## Design Principles

### 1. Mobile-First, Always

If it doesn't work well on a phone, it doesn't work. Period. Service professionals live on their phones.

### 2. Speed Matters

Every second counts when you're trying to get information between calls or while on a job site. Fast loading, instant updates, minimal clicks.

### 3. Offline Capability

Service professionals work in basements, attics, and remote locations. The app needs to work even when connectivity is spotty.

### 4. Real-Time Updates

When a job changes, everyone needs to know immediately. Real-time synchronization isn't a nice-to-have, it's essential.

## Technical Choices

Building with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev) gives us:
- Fast page loads
- Great mobile performance
- Real-time capabilities
- Modern developer experience

## The Feedback Loop

The best features come from real users solving real problems. I'm constantly talking to service professionals, understanding their workflows, and building features that actually help.

## What's Next

The service industry is still underserved by technology. There's so much opportunity to build tools that genuinely make people's lives easier. That's what keeps me building.

If you're working in this space or thinking about it, I'd love to connect. The problems are real, and the solutions are worth building together.
