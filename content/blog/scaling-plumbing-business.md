In the high-stakes world of contracting, the gap between a hard worker and a business owner is often a canyon filled with debt, stress, and hard lessons. For Wade's Plumbing & Septic, bridging that gap wasn't just a business pivot, it was a personal transformation.

Building a company at 25 is a feat of energy; rebuilding it with wisdom is a feat of character. This is the story of how I scaled a plumbing business to $2.4 million in sales, nearly lost it all to the chaos of growth, and returned with a blueprint for sustainable success.

## Filling the Void: The Rapid Rise

The origin story of Wade's Plumbing & Septic is one of pure hustle. At 25 years old, I looked at the market and saw a glaring inefficiency: customers were desperate. In an industry plagued by contractors who wouldn't pick up the phone or show up on time, I realized that simply **being there** and doing the hard work was a competitive advantage no one else could match.

The strategy worked—too well.

"We filled the void," as I recall. The company exploded in size, scaling to 13 employees and generating $2.4 million in annual sales. From the outside, it looked like the American Dream. Crews were dispatching across Santa Cruz County, CA, and eventually Pickens County, GA, tackling everything from complex trenchless sewer replacements to alternative septic system installations.

But inside, the foundation was cracking.

## The $2.4 Million Trap

Revenue is vanity; profit is sanity. Wade's Plumbing had plenty of the former and very little of the latter. The company was built on the back of a "nice guy" philosophy. I was eager to please and unsure of my authority, and I allowed the lines between friend and boss to blur.

"I was too nice," I admit. "People stepped all over me."

Without proper management structures or pricing models, the massive revenue numbers were misleading. The company was bleeding cash on overhead, underquoting jobs to win work, and managing a team that lacked clear direction. The "hard work" ethos that launched the company became its Achilles' heel. My co-owner, who I credit as an amazing partner, and I were in the trenches, blind to the fact that we were digging ourselves into a hole.

The breaking point was inevitable. The stress of managing 13 employees without systems, combined with financial bleeding, forced me to step away. It was a humbling collapse for a company that had looked so successful on paper.

## The Education of a "Million Dollar Plumber"

Stepping away proved to be the most profitable move I ever made. I didn't just quit; I went to school on the industry.

Working for other companies, I saw the stark difference between *running calls* and *running a business*. I realized my mistake wasn't a lack of plumbing knowledge, I knew everything a person could learn about the trade, but a lack of *business* literacy.

I invested in myself, taking business management classes and enrolling in the **Million Dollar Plumbing** course by Richard Behney. This was the paradigm shift. The course taught me that a plumbing business isn't just about fixing pipes; it's about fixing the systems that deliver the service.

I learned:

**The Psychology of Sales**: Moving from "taking orders" to providing professional options that serve the client better.

**True Pricing**: Understanding that "market price" is irrelevant if it doesn't cover overhead and net profit.

**Leadership**: The crucial shift from being the "nice person" who is liked, to the "wise person" who is respected.

## Wade's Plumbing & Septic Reborn

Today, Wade's Plumbing & Septic operates with a renewed vision. The company that once thrived on chaos now thrives on structure. The brand's public promise, "Real People, Real Service," is now backed by real systems.

The changes are visible in how we operate:

**Specialized Expertise**: Instead of just "showing up," the company now dominates niche markets like **alternative septic system design** for difficult terrains (steep slopes, poor soil) and advanced **leak detection**.

**Transparent Client Relations**: The "nice guy" fear of charging money has been replaced by professional transparency. Customers receive honest, "no-sales-pressure" recommendations that solve problems for the long term, rather than cheap band-aid fixes.

**Operational Discipline**: With a footprint that spans from the California coast to the Georgia mountains, the logistics are now handled with the precision of a technology-driven company, a nod to my background in tech.

## The Lesson

The journey of Wade's Plumbing & Septic is a case study for every young tradesperson. Hard work can get you to your first million, but only wisdom can keep you there.

"I quickly realized what I had messed up and where and why my company failed when I could have done so much better for myself, my family, my business partner, and my community," I reflect.

But this realization wasn't the end, it was the beginning of the real company. Wade's Plumbing & Septic is no longer just a group of guys who show up; it is a professional institution built to last, led by an owner who learned that the kindest thing you can do for your employees and customers is to run a profitable, well-managed business.

## Applying These Lessons to Software

The principles that saved my plumbing business directly inform how I build software today. Building [Thorbis](https://thorbis.com) is my way of applying these lessons to help other service professionals succeed:

- **Systems over chaos**: Just like in plumbing, field service software needs proper architecture and structure
- **Transparency over confusion**: Clear pricing, honest recommendations, and straightforward workflows
- **Wisdom over features**: Understanding what service professionals actually need, not just what sounds impressive
- **Sustainable growth**: Building for the long term, not just rapid expansion

The same mistakes I made in plumbing, being too nice, lacking systems, focusing on revenue over profit, are the same mistakes I see service companies making with their software choices. Thorbis is built to help them avoid those pitfalls and build sustainable, profitable operations.
