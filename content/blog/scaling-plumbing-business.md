Starting a plumbing business in Santa Cruz, California was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. Going from zero to **$2.4M** in revenue during my second year taught me more about business, operations, and problem-solving than I could have learned anywhere else.

## The Beginning

I started with just myself, a truck, and a lot of determination. The first few months were about building trust, doing quality work, and learning the business from the ground up.

## What Worked

### 1. Quality Over Everything

In a service business, your reputation is everything. One bad job can undo months of good work. I focused on:
- Doing the job right the first time
- Being honest about timelines and costs
- Following up to ensure customer satisfaction

### 2. Systems and Processes

As the business grew, I had to build systems that could scale:
- Standardized pricing
- Clear communication protocols
- Efficient scheduling
- Reliable dispatch

### 3. Team Building

You can't scale alone. Finding the right people and creating a culture where quality work is valued made all the difference.

## The Challenges

Scaling wasn't without its challenges:
- Managing growth while maintaining quality
- Finding and retaining good technicians
- Cash flow management
- Balancing field work with business operations

## The Transition

Eventually, complications led me to move to Georgia, which was a major transition. But the lessons learned from scaling that business directly inform how I build software today.

## Lessons for Software Development

The principles that worked in plumbing apply to software:
- Solve real problems
- Focus on quality
- Build systems that scale
- Listen to your users
