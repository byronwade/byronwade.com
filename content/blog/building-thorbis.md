excerpt: "How my experience running a plumbing business led me to build field management software that solves real problems."
---

After scaling my plumbing business to **$2.4M** in revenue during my second year, I learned firsthand about the challenges service professionals face every day. The gap between field work and digital management was massive, and existing solutions didn't quite fit the way service businesses actually operate.

## The Problem

When you're running a service business, you're juggling:
- Scheduling and dispatch
- Customer communication
- Job tracking and invoicing
- Team coordination
- Inventory management

Most software solutions are either too complex or too simple. They don't understand the unique workflow of service professionals who spend their days in the field, not behind a desk.

## The Solution

That's why I built [Thorbis](https://thorbis.com) - a field management system designed specifically for service professionals. Built with modern JavaScript frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev), it bridges the gap between field work and digital management.

### Key Features

1. **Mobile-First Design**: Built for technicians who work on their phones
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Jobs update instantly across all devices
3. **Simple Workflow**: Designed around how service businesses actually operate
4. **Modern Tech Stack**: Fast, reliable, and always improving

## The Journey

Building Thorbis has been a journey of understanding. Every feature comes from real experience - either my own or from conversations with other service professionals. The goal isn't to add every possible feature, but to solve the core problems that matter most.

## What's Next

I'm constantly iterating based on feedback from service professionals. The best software is built in partnership with the people who use it every day.

If you're a service professional looking for better tools, or a developer interested in building for this space, I'd love to hear from you. The problems are real, and the solutions are worth building.
