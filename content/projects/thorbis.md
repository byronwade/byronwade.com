[Thorbis](https://thorbis.com) is a field management system designed specifically for service professionals. Built with modern JavaScript frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev), it bridges the gap between field work and digital management.

## The Problem

Service professionals face unique challenges that traditional software doesn't address:

- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Technicians work on their phones, not behind desks
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Jobs change, schedules shift, updates need to happen instantly
- **Simple but Powerful**: Tools need to be intuitive but handle complex workflows
- **Field-Ready**: Works offline, in basements, attics, and remote locations

## The Solution

Thorbis was built from my own experience scaling a plumbing business to **$2.4M** in revenue. I know firsthand what service professionals need because I've been there.

### Key Features

- **Mobile-First Design**: Built for technicians who work on their phones
- **Real-Time Updates**: Jobs update instantly across all devices
- **Simple Workflow**: Designed around how service businesses actually operate
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Fast, reliable, and always improving

## Technology

Built with:
- **Next.js** for fast page loads and great mobile performance
- **React** for modern, interactive user interfaces
- **Real-time capabilities** for instant updates
- **Mobile optimization** for field technicians

## What's Next

I'm constantly iterating based on feedback from service professionals. The best software is built in partnership with the people who use it every day.
