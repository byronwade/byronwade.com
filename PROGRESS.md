# AI agents blog draft progress

Operating mode: Implementation. Stay in `bot/blog-post` in this worktree.

Plan: sync origin/main; read all six existing posts and content consumers; write
one 900–1500 word first-person draft; add minimal centralized draft exclusion;
verify local rendering with screenshots and production exclusion; run local
lint, type-check, knip, and build; review the diff; push and open a ready PR.

Acceptance: valid existing frontmatter plus `draft: true`; 900–1500 visible
words; dev slug renders; production listing hides the draft; all author TODOs
listed in the PR; checks pass. No publishing, merging, external messages,
new design primitives, or edits to other worktrees.

Existing candidates: `lib/blog.ts` owns loading; `/blog`, RSS, sitemap, route
generation, and search consume it. No draft filtering exists. Extend that owner
instead of adding route-specific filters. Reuse existing Markdown rendering.
Dependency cone: one new post, blog loader, focused native Node regression,
and these local handoff notes. No visual or motion changes planned.

Loop 1: merged origin/main at c69030b, including contact and Node 24 changes.
Read all six posts and required guidance. Draft written (1159 whitespace-delimited
body words, excluding frontmatter and HTML comments); three author TODOs.
Extended the canonical blog loader to hide drafts outside development, sharing
that boundary with list, direct lookup, and slug consumers. Removed duplicated
frontmatter parsing and raw slug enumeration. Added native Node regression
coverage for development, production, test, explicit false, and absent draft.
No UI, token, or motion changes. Existing reading surface: prose dominant,
workflow sequence; inspect desktop/mobile, light/dark, keyboard/reduced motion.

Toolkit reservation and job launcher both failed on a missing unrelated configured
root. Do not change toolkit config; use ordinary hidden local command execution.
Dependencies absent in this worktree; npm ci running. Design-system branch is not
yet on origin; recheck before opening the PR. Next: commit/push, run checks and
rendered verification, then record results here and in RESULT.md.
