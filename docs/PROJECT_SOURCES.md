# Projects refresh sources

Reviewed October 15–16, 2026. Research is limited to Byron's public GitHub repositories
and existing site copy. Current-work selection and names come from Byron's brief;
an Active label identifies the portfolio group, not a released product. No new
metrics, clients, adoption figures, or measured outcomes are claimed.

| Project | Sources | Limits / follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thorbis Network / FMS | [Public repository](https://github.com/byronwade/local.thorbis.com), [README](https://github.com/byronwade/local.thorbis.com/blob/main/README.md), [previous site write-up](https://github.com/byronwade/byronwade.com/blob/38261e9/content/projects/thorbis.md) | Conservative service-business scope only. Older public README and existing site describe different stack generations, so no current stack or launch claim. TODO confirms Network/FMS naming; the earlier CMS article uses FMS for agriculture. |
| Thorbis Design | [Existing site port notes](https://github.com/byronwade/byronwade.com/blob/30cceba/docs/THORBIS-DESIGN-PORT.md), [site design contract](https://github.com/byronwade/byronwade.com/blob/30cceba/DESIGN.md), Byron's supplied design.thorbis.com address | The published design-system implementation establishes this site's CSS/Tailwind port and Base UI interaction layer. It replaces the earlier provisional association with the separate Design repository. TODO covers preferred public upstream link, dates, wider adoption, and outcomes; no published-package claim. |
| Subfield | [Public repository inventory](https://api.github.com/users/byronwade/repos?per_page=100), existing site search | No matching public description found. Name and current selection only; TODO requests scope, links, stack, dates. |
| Hollowveil | [Public repository inventory](https://api.github.com/users/byronwade/repos?per_page=100), existing site search | No matching public description found. No genre or features inferred. TODO requests description and category confirmation. |
| Movies | [Repository](https://github.com/byronwade/movies.byronwade.com), [home route](https://github.com/byronwade/movies.byronwade.com/blob/main/src/routes/index.tsx), [package manifest](https://github.com/byronwade/movies.byronwade.com/blob/main/package.json) | Source supports a discovery feed and React/TypeScript/TanStack Start/Router/Vite. TODO requests canonical URL, dates, release state. No launch, user, or recommendation-quality claim. |
| Realistic Face | [Public repository inventory](https://api.github.com/users/byronwade/repos?per_page=100), existing site search | No matching public description found. No model, dataset, technique, or realism claim. TODO requests details. |
| Drone PI | [Public repository inventory](https://api.github.com/users/byronwade/repos?per_page=100), existing site search | No matching public description found. No hardware or flight capability inferred. TODO requests details. |
| ODB2 | [Public repository inventory](https://api.github.com/users/byronwade/repos?per_page=100), existing site search | Spelling retained from brief. No vehicle-diagnostics assumption. TODO confirms ODB2/OBD2 and details. |
| Plumbing Code Playbook / The Trust Sale | [Public repository inventory](https://api.github.com/users/byronwade/repos?per_page=100), existing site search | One combined entry as requested. No title-specific public source found. The separate academy repository does not establish facts about these titles. TODO confirms format, relationship, publication state, and links. |

The unauthenticated public inventory returned 39 repositories. Direct public API
lookups for the unmatched names returned 404; that is an absence of public evidence,
not evidence that a project does not exist. No private repositories were consulted.

All nine current entries contain frontmatter TODO comments. Unknown dates are
omitted rather than assigned the build date. Existing Thorbis date is retained.
Unverified categories are omitted; unknown work has a neutral Project label instead
of being classified as Hobby by default.

The fifteen earlier write-ups and all their other frontmatter are preserved.
Only `status`, `featured`, and existing `flagship` fields change to establish the
earlier-work group and remove older entries from the homepage's featured set.
Archived here is an editorial grouping; no GitHub repositories are archived.

## Earlier-work performance claims, October 20, 2026

The Zugzology case study (`content/projects/mushroom-cultivation-supplier.md`)
previously claimed 80% fewer database queries, 70–80% faster loads, an 8+ second
initial load, and a 2MB+ product payload. No supporting benchmark, workload,
measurement date, or source was found in this repository or the introducing
content commit (`ef54a5a0`). Those figures and unmeasured performance guarantees
have been removed. The write-up retains its described caching and streaming
approaches; it does not establish measured results for them. Restoring metrics
requires a source and a reproducible before/after comparison.
This correction does not independently verify the inherited feature list,
production usage, scaling capacity, or field-management roadmap.

## Zugzology AI claims, October 20, 2026

The same case study described a multi-provider "enterprise AI/ML system"
(recommendations, behavior analysis, sentiment analysis, segmentation, market
basket analysis, A/B testing) as part of the current store. The store's public
repository, [byronwade/zugzology.com](https://github.com/byronwade/zugzology.com),
shows otherwise:

- Commit [`a509ce9d`](https://github.com/byronwade/zugzology.com/commit/a509ce9dd04df8f450c2bf1421dc142817cc963c)
  (2025-10-15, "Major architectural restructuring") deleted `app/api/ai/*`
  (behavior-analysis, demand-forecasting, enhance-product, personalize-homepage,
  recommendations, search-suggestions, sentiment-analysis, support,
  user-segmentation) and `components/ai/*`, including the A/B testing framework.
- Commit [`b7a6d695`](https://github.com/byronwade/zugzology.com/commit/b7a6d695110913681e1e9b9593b8387aa03b1d43)
  (2026-07-31) deleted the remaining `src/app/api/analytics/ab-test` route.
- At HEAD [`5b7f80d8`](https://github.com/byronwade/zugzology.com/tree/5b7f80d81b4819f9d38f51da89bf3247763077ed),
  `package.json` has no OpenAI, Anthropic, or Groq SDK, and product order comes from
  [`src/lib/ranking/product-ranker.ts`](https://github.com/byronwade/zugzology.com/blob/5b7f80d81b4819f9d38f51da89bf3247763077ed/src/lib/ranking/product-ranker.ts)
  ("without external dependencies or AI"), called from
  `src/components/features/products/realtime-products-content.tsx`.
- The removed system's statistical fallback when no provider key is set is
  documented in that repository's `docs/AI_PREDICTIONS_STATUS.md`.

This site's case study was added in `ef54a5a0` (2025-12-02), after the removal,
so the AI passages were stale when published. They now describe the AI layer as
a removed experiment and the ranker as current. Added feature-list items (typed
analytics events, a Web Vitals route, Google Merchant/Facebook feeds, a Shopify
outage degraded mode) come from routes and components present at that HEAD;
whether custom analytics events record in production depends on the Vercel plan
and was not checked. "Proven Scalability" / "thousands of products", "already
handling production traffic", and "self-sustaining" revenue had no recorded load
test, traffic, or revenue source and are now worded as design intent. No reason
for the AI removal is given because the commit does not state one. The
repository's own `docs/ENTERPRISE_AI_SYSTEM.md` still describes the deleted system;
it was not edited.

## Wade's Plumbing mobile-traffic figure, October 20, 2026

`content/projects/wades-plumbing-and-septic.md` said 80% of local-service traffic
comes from phones and called mobile speed a "massive ranking factor". Neither had
a source, so the figure is removed and the sentence now says page experience is
one Google ranking signal. The front-matter outcome "ranks in two markets" is
also unsourced and is left for Byron to confirm.
